</br>Shanti
</br>Alchemy co-founder and executive chef, Shanti started her career in some of Sweden’s best restaurants. She believed that culinary creation was an expression of love, but this concept seemed at odds with commercial food practices, and the modern Western diet. Converted to raw veganism, she discovered a world of pure, organic produce, and has since become known for transforming it to culinary art. Shanti is the author of The Raw Alchemist – over 100 raw and vegan recipes from Alchemy Restaurant, and the founder of the newly opened Alchemy Academy, Bali’s first raw vegan culinary school. As a mother of twins brought up on green juice, she uses the ‘crowding out’ method to inspire (read: trick) her boys into making their own healthy food choices.
</br>

</br>
</br>We have a range of other experts contributing to the curriculum. To mention a few, we have Paula Uchoa, former teacher at Plant Lab and Matthew Kenney Culinary, Heath Street as our mindfulness teacher and conscious business coach, Luciano from Mozaic Kombucha, our fermentation expert, and Chef Made Runata, founder of Moksa restaurant in Ubud.
