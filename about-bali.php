<h2>About Bali</h2>h2>
<p>The town of Ubud is the cultural and spiritual center of the Indonesian island of Bali. Ubud was once called “Ubad”, meaning “Medicine” in Balinese, referring not only to the medicinal plants and herbs that grow in abundance here, but also to the healing power of this sacred ground. Ubud has long been known for its powerful curative energy, and for centuries, people have flocked to this oasis for healing. </p>
<p>Ubud is also a showcase of culinary inventiveness. And when it comes to raw, vegan food you find the very best that the world has to offer. The ministry of tourism has nominated Ubud as a world “gastronomy destination”, making it the first in the world to receive a designation from the United Nations World Tourism Organization for culinary excellence.</p>
<p>Colorful offerings of flowers and incense adorning each street corner, calming the eyes and mind, and the seductive nature of this town can easily turn a short holiday into a stay of months or even years. </p>

<h3>PASSPORT</h3>
<p>Important:<em> Please check your passport to ensure that it has minimum 6 months validity beyond your date of entry, as this is required to enter the country of Indonesia. For social visa the passport must be valid for minimum 12 months.</em> Immigration officials tend to be strict about these requirements.</p>
<h3>AIRPORT PICK-UP</h3>
<p>Getting from the Airport to Ubud by car will take around 1.5 hours. The taxi rate is IDR 300,000 (approx. 23 USD). You can pre-book one of our trusted taxi drivers ahead by whatsapp. Please provide your name, your date and time of arrival, airline, flight number and location of last departure.

<p>Raditya + 62 818 0363 5408</p>
<h3>CURRENCY</h3>
<p>The currency is Indonesian Rupiah (IDR). <br /> USD 1 = IDR 14,000 (approximately)</p>
<p>ATMs are available in Ubud, usually with withdrawal fees using foreign bank cards. Beware of skimmers and rigged units. There are also many foreign exchange kiosks at the airport and in Ubud. It is recommended to always count the money you receive and double check with your own calculator that it is the correct exchange rate. Major hotels, restaurants and shops accept credit cards. A few percent handeling charge is often added. The exchange rate at the time of using the card in Bali may be different from when it is billed to you in your country.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll find there is often one price for locals and one price for tourists in Bali, but if you&rsquo;re savvy you can barter for something in between.</p>
<h3>LANGUAGE</h3>
<p>There are two native languages in Bali. The official language is Indonesian, while the local language is Balinese. At hotels and major tourist sites, there are staff capable of speaking English.<br /> </p>
<p>LOCAL NAMES<br /> There are a lot of Wayans. All Balinese share the same four names - Wayan, Kadek, Nyoman or Ketut &ndash; whether they're male or female, and are named by order of birth. If a family has a fifth child, they will start again and call him or her Wayan. It can cause quite some confusion, but most Balinese will have a nickname so they can be distinguished. </p>

<h3>TRANSPORTATION</h3>
<p>Driving in Bali is on the left side, a bit chaotic and unpredictable, with narrow roads, few side-walks, not many road signs, and plenty of chickens and dogs on the road. You see many people on scooters and mopeds, and If you wish rent a scooter to get around the price is about IDR 60,000 (less than 5 USD) per day. If you don't like driving yourself there is moped-taxi (gojek) which is very affordable. If you prefer the safer alternative, it is recommended to go by car. There are plenty of taxi drivers offering their services on call. I recommend to negotiate the price beforehand.</p>
<p>It is possible to rent a car without a driver and drive on your own (you need international driving license), but it's not much cheaper than hiring a car with driver. <br /> </p>
<h3>INSURANCE AND SAFETY</h3>
<p>There are a few cases of pickpockets and purse-snatching. When you go out, don&rsquo;t take all valuables with you and when you walk on the sidewalks, don&rsquo;t carry your bag on the road side. Don&rsquo;t leave cards or cash accessible. Keep valuables, including your passport and cash, in the safety deposit box at your hotel.<br /> <br /> Just in case there are any unexpected unfortunate events such as illness or having your belongings stolen, we recommend you to get overseas accident insurance before departing your country.</p>
<p>It is recommended to make copies of your passport, travel insurance, and other important travel documents. Should you loose your passport, having a photocopy of it will greatly expedite getting a replacement from an embassy in Asia.</p>
<h3>WATER</h3>
<p>Drink filtered water only, and brush your teeth in it too. Many hotels and resorts provide complimentary filtered water.</p>
<h3>CLIMATE</h3>
<p>Bali has a tropical monsoon climate. April to September is the dry season and October to March, the rainy season. However, rainy season will vary and is not predictable. The most rain comes between December and February. <br /> </p>
<p>ELECTRICAL PLUGS<br /> Electricity in Bali is 230 Volts, 50Hz. If the standard voltage in your country is between 220V - 240V you can use your electric appliances in Indonesia. Electrical plugs are two-pronged &lsquo;Europlug&rsquo; type. The pins are round, not flat or rectangular. If you come from Australia, Japan, USA, Malaysia, UK, Canada, Singapore, and some countries in Africa you will most likely need a plug adapter otherwise the plugs for your electrical appliances will not fit into the Bali Socket. You can easily find an adapter at all international airports, and also in Bali they are commonly found in many shops for a few dollars. </p>
