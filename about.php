   <h3>Shanti Allen</h3>
   </br> 
Shanti Allen is a classically trained chef who started her career in some of Europe’s finest restaurants. She believed that culinary creation was an expression of love, but this concept seemed at odds with commercial food practices and the modern Western diet. Converted to raw veganism, she discovered a world of pure, organic produce, and has since become known for transforming it into culinary art. 
  </br>  </br>
Originally from Sweden, her passion for food and longevity lured her to the health food capital of the world, Ubud, where she joined a team of talented Alchemists in founding Alchemy, Bali’s first 100% raw & vegan restaurant and health establishment.
  </br>  </br>
She has been named an "Island Trailblazer" in Let's Eat Magazine - The Womens Issue, and featured in numerous other publications including Inspired Bali, Bali & Beyond, The Foodie Magazine, and ethicalfoods.com. She has also published articles and recipes for Yogi times and Bali & Beyond.
